## No excuse user research

As designers and developers, we don’t always have access to research to about our end users, or the opportunity to learn about them. This can leave us building products based on our managers personal opinion, or client specifications, and never really knowing how we can serve our users better.But the good news is there are many opportunities for user research that most designers and developers just aren’t aware of. They are cheap, easy to implement, and can used straight away on almost any project.
