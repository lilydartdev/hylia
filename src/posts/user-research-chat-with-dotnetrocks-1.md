I had the privilege of spending an hour with the lovely Carl and Richard from DotNetRocks podcast while I was at NDC London last month.

We talked about everything from the problem with focus groups, guerrilla usability testing, usability research with internal search logs and why you shouldn’t call it “user testing”.
