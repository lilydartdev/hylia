Previous talks



Building stronger teams for better user experience

Keynote at EpicFEL 2015



We’ve all heard that “user experience is everyone’s responsibility”. But when the whole team is responsible for UX, how can we ensure the quality and consistency? During this talk I’ll explain that style guides and documentation can only take us so far; stronger teams are the key to better UX.





No excuse user research

NDC London 2016



As designers and developers, we don’t always have access to research to about our end users, or the opportunity to learn about them. This can leave us building products based on our managers personal opinion, or client specifications, and never really knowing how we can serve our users better.But the good news is there are many opportunities for user research that most designers and developers just aren’t aware of. They are cheap, easy to implement, and can used straight away on almost any project.





Help colleagues to understand needs through user research

Agile Content Conf 2016



We want our colleagues to understand the value of meeting user needs so that they can work with us to publish content. Often, taking a user-centred approach involves changing practices, which is difficult for everyone. User research can help in two ways. As well as helping to create content that meets user needs, it can also help us to show colleagues the value of our approach, easing their transition to a new way of working.





Quick Start Guide to Guerrilla Usability Testing

WordCamp London 2015



Guerrilla usability testing is an inexpensive and speedy way to put users at the centre of your design process. It can help to keep clients focused on strategic goals, over personal their colour preferences. Lily shows you how to design and run a guerrilla usability testing session to get valuable feedback from people on the street.





The ups and downs of agency agile

NorDevCon 2014



When you’re working on the front lines with a client who has the drive to do things right, but is still limited by their timescale and budget, how can you make agile work?





Designers are Leaders, and Leaders are Designers

SyncDevelopHER 2014



User experience is everyone’s responsibility. So, how do UX designers help the team deliver great experiences, when they aren’t in control?



Effective designers and good leaders have many qualities in common. I’ll show how we can use existing skills, and leadership thinking, to deliver great UX.
